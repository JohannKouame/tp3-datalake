This is short  lived , however , as following Maximilian s defeat , Dahau and Calamity Raven move to activate an ancient Valkyrian super weapon within the Empire , kept secret by their benefactor . Without the support of Maximilian or the chance to prove themselves in the war with Gallia , it is Dahau s last trump card in creating a new Darcsen nation . As an armed Gallian force invading the Empire just following the two nations  cease  fire would certainly wreck their newfound peace , Kurt decides to once again make his squad the Nameless , asking Crowe to list himself and all under his command as killed  in  action . Now owing allegiance to none other than themselves , the 422nd confronts Dahau and destroys the Valkyrian weapon . Each member then goes their separate ways in order to begin their lives anew .'

Speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series  first true sequel  while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform .

Milne  Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 .'
